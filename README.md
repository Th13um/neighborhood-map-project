# Map Project

Final Project for the Udacity FEND course. Map displays 5 locations from a JSON file on a Google Map. User can filter locations from a list view via a text search. User can click on a location both on the map and from the list view and the marker will be focussed and info window appears.

## API Access Token
You will however require a Facebook Graphi API Access Token to run the app completely. In the App.JS replace the FacebookAccessToken variable value to your access token.
